# What is this?
This is a total rip-off of speed runs live

## Why?
I think it's time that we admit to ourselves that speed runs live as a site is not getting any better, there are certain thigs that I have identified that can be vastly improved upon, firstly I propose that a site is created that emulates all of the current functionality of speedruns live but once it is complete we add more what has been missing from that site for so long!

## I've thought of something cool I want to add! 
Awesome - file an issue (if you would like to help contribute then you can do so by reading on about how to do that)

## So what do you think is missing?

### Open Source
This increases the bus factor - I'm guessing that if this is a hit I will hand it off to some more people to look after, let's people contribute to make this place the best it can be.

### Mobile Friendlyness
I think it is fair to say that browser traffic has moved away from desktop - most people are watching from a tablet or from a phone, best way to use this information is to use a css framework that is setup to be responsive.

### Discord bot
No one uses MIRC - or if they do they use it literally to setup races and nothing else, I believe a discord bot would help the community immensly

### Multiple streaming sites
Turns out there is more than one streaming site, I beleve that speedruns live only works with twitch so there is a goal that this site will work with mixer, youtube and any others that come along so those runners can get representation.

# Hosting
This will be hosted on Azure (CI/CD to follow sooner or later) on a subscription most likely in the UK this may or may not change depending on how far we can take it

## Who will fund this?
Not something I'm thinking about right now - maybe we'll think about donations sooner or later, or maybe advertisements, I'm not 100% but for right now it's small enough to fund on my own.

# Development 

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Dot net core 3.1 (LTS)
- Modern c# ide (VS 2019, VSCode, Rider)
- Azure functions dev kit (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local)

## Why blazor and not x framework
I'll be the first to admit that I dislike javascript and I want to play around with what I think will soon be the default framework for c# developers

You can learn about blazor here - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor

### Will you be moving to client side blazor when that's a thing?
Maybe - it depends on how difficult the transition is.

## Why c#/aspnet?
That's what I am most familier with, it was a purely selfish choice
